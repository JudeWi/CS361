# CS361
This is my Github repo for CS361 via Ecampus at Oregon State University.

Communication contract:
Ideally this will end up being a remote process that essentially acts as an interface with mongodb.
It'll have a few different functions, such as a Save(), Overwrite(), and Load().

I haven't figured out how to make it work yet, so this is all still up in the air. Might make it so that it saves stuff just as JSON objects instead, we'll see!
